Download a program from github called dtmf-decoder.  Converted the mp3 to wav using ffmpeg.

Get the following stream of tones.

44422226684433277788

Just listen and determine which tones have pauses between them, and then use a picture of
a phone to decode the DTMF tones into letters like we are texting someone old-school.
